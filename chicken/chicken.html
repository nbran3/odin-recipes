            <h3> Grilling Instructions </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li> Marinate the chicken. Add the chicken breasts to the marinade and mix well to coat in the marinade. Allow chicken to marinate for at least 30 minutes to two hours.</li>
                    <li> Prepare the grill. As the chicken marinates, clean the grill grates and lightly oil with vegetable oil or cooking spray. Set grill to medium-high heat. </li>
                    <li> Grill the chicken. Remove the chicken from the marinade and place directly on the grill. Discard remaining marinade. Cover the grill and allow the chicken to cook for approximately 5 minutes before reducing heat to medium. Allow chicken to cook for an additional 2 minutes, then use tongs to flip each breast over. Grill for an additional 5-7 minutes (or longer), or until the thickest part of your chicken registers 160 degrees F. with a digital meat thermometer. </li>
                    <li> Thicker chicken breasts will take longer to cook. I highly recommend the use of a digital meat thermometer when cooking any and all meats </li>
                    <li> Allow chicken to rest. Remove chicken breasts from the grill and set aside to a clean plate. Tent with foil and allow to rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving. </li>
                </ol>
            <h4> Baking Instructions </h4>
                <ol>
                    <li> <strong>Prepare the marinade</strong> as outlined above <strong>and marinate the chicken</strong> for (at least) 30 minutes. </li>
                    <li> <strong>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F</strong> and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. </li>
                    <li> <strong>Arrange the chicken on the prepared baking sheet.</strong> Discard any remaining marinade. </li>
                    <li> <strong>Bake</strong> until internal temperature reaches 160-165 degrees F as read with a digital meat thermometer. </li>
                    <li> Remove from the oven and <strong> allow to rest for 5 minutes </strong> before serving. </li>
                </ol>
